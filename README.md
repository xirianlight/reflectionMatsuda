So, this repo represents a large bulk of the notes I took during the MobileMakers iOS Immersive course. There be demonds here. If you're brave enough to poke around, please be aware that you are like to be offended. The language is coarse, as it is unfiltered. 

Not a lot to see here, but, a great repository of some zaniness and wonderful memories.
